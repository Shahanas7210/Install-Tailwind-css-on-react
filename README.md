# Install Tailwind css on react

## 1. Create a new project:
If you haven't already created your project, you can use the following commands to create a new project with your preferred package manager (npm or yarn). Replace your-project-name with your actual project name.'

For npm:

```bash
  npx create-react-app your-project-name
```





For yarn:
yarn create react-app your-project-name

# 2. Install Tailwind CSS and dependencies:
Navigate to your project directory and install the required packages. Tailwind CSS requires PostCSS, so you'll need to install both.
